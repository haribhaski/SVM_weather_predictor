This project was done by me for the subject Mathematics for Computing - 2

In this project i have create a linear Kernal multiclass SVM to predict weather for the city of Mumbai.

The database "Mumbai 1.csv" was sourced from a government website and i have made changes to the original with respect to my requirement (I forgot the website name).
This database contains various classes that might be needed to predict weather in the city of Mumbai. You can change the dataase if you wish to create a predictro for another city.

BEWARE do not use this predictor for cities other than Mumbai Metropolitan Area as it WILL BE WRONG.

Remember to change the classes in the code respect to the classes present in your database (If you changed it).

The SVM has 3 functions, one is to predict, other is for training and the last one is for invoking. The SVM code made is completely devoid of ay major IN-BUILT functions and has been
built completely from scratch. You can change the SVM based on your requirement.

Thank you.
